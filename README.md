## Project Overview

This repository contains a literature review and an interactive SurVis browser covering 10 key research papers in the area of synthetic medical X-ray image generation using generative AI models — including Transformers, LoRA/QLoRA, and Diffusion models.

### Key Components:
- Paper summaries with focus on methodology and evaluation types
- Literature classification and histogram
- A SurVis-powered interactive browser
- Visuals from each paper with descriptions

### Research Structure and Methodology

This project follows the literature review structure outlined in:

> Firat, E. E., Joshi, A., & Laramee, R. S. (2022). *Interactive Visualization Literacy: The State-of-the-Art*. Information Visualization, 21(3), 285–310. [https://doi.org/10.1177/14738716221081831](https://doi.org/10.1177/14738716221081831)

The evaluation classification strategy, SurVis screenshot, histogram, and summary format are directly inspired by their state-of-the-art review approach. Their work served as both a model and benchmark.

### SurVis Framework

This literature browser is powered by **SurVis**, an open-source visual interface for survey authors:
